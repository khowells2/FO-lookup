"FO 950","Foreign Office: Claims Department: Correspondence and Claims Files.","Foreign Office: Claims Department: Correspondence and Claims Files","This series contains files of the Claims Department concerning compensation claims by British nationals against foreign governments arising out of the Second World War and subsequent claims by individuals and the government against foreign states, and by foreign states and their nationals against the United Kingdom. The series includes a collection of compensation claims files for those British nationals who suffered Nazi persecution and who made a claim under the British Victims of Nazi Persecution compensation agreement for Nazi persecution by British nationals. The files were created by the Foreign Office Claims Department in 1964 to record British enquiries and claims for compensation. The Nazi persecution claim files (prefix HNP) consists of a completed standard form, personal (mainly handwritten) testimonies of Nazi persecution recording events and occurrences, documenting individuals' experiences during the holocaust and internment in concentration camps or prisons, and related correspondence. The series also includes files about the Foreign Compensation Commission's activities, and administration files relating to the Nazi Persecution claim files. The Nazi persecution claim (HNP) files from FO 950/830 comprise the following: Files that were created but have empty file covers; these are listed and prepared in the same way as other pieces, except that (empty cover) is added at the end of each description. It is possible that a file for the same individual may be elsewhere in this series. Files that were created but never progressed to a full claim. Files that were created but the claimant was not successful. The series also contains pre-Second World War material, in particular files concerning enemy debts from the post-First World War period.
Administrative history: In November 1945 a Claims Section was established within the Consular Department to deal with claims from members of the public in respect of damage resulting from the Second World War. Its responsibilities included both cases of claims made against the British government by foreign governments and those where there was any question of the British government taking up individual grievances with foreign governments, and were similar to those performed by the Foreign Claims Office set up during the First World War. Much of the work had previously been dealt with by the Political Departments and the Foreign Office legal adviser. In May 1946 the section became a separate Claims Department; its area of responsibility was still restricted to war claims, but it was intended that it would eventually handle all claims matters reaching the Foreign Office. In 1958 it again became a section of the Consular Department, and a separate department once more in 1960. From 1964, the Foreign Office Claims Department was responsible for reviewing compensation claims in accordance with the Agreement between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Federal Republic of Germany concerning Compensation for United Kingdom Nationals who were Victims of National-Socialist Measures of Persecution (TS No 42, 1964). The agreement was announced by the Foreign Secretary on the 9 June 1964, in a statement to the House of Commons. Applications for claims closed on 31 March 1966.
Arrangement: From the beginning of 1950 a revised filing system was adopted by the Foreign Office. This system was based on: i) an initial letter (or letters) indicating the Department concerned; ii) a file number; iii) a further number indicating the particular paper in the file. A separate series of code numbers for countries was used together with file numbers for papers filed in the Claims, Consular and Information Policy Departments. This modification does not affect the basic filing principle, thus KG 1021/7 stands for paper 7 on file 1 in the Consular Department's Argentina series. Claims Department index letters: H - Claims; H - General; HG - Geographical; HNP - Claims, Nazi Persecution.","01/01/1919","19190101","31/12/1990","19901231","1919-1990","The National Archives, Kew","3","","","","Normal Closure before FOI Act:","30","C10019 Conflict;

"FO 369","Foreign Office: Consular Department: General Correspondence from 1906.","Foreign Office: Consular Department: General Correspondence from 1906","This series contains correspondence, etc, of the Consular Department.
Administrative history: A separate Consular Department was set up in 1825 to deal with the consular correspondence of the Foreign Office. Between 1866 and 1872 it was combined with the Commercial Department as the Consular and Commercial Department, between 1872 and 1880 with the Slave Trade Department as the Consular and Slave Trade Department, and between 1882 and 1893 with the African Department as the Consular and African (East and West) Department. Between 1912 and 1919 a controller of commercial and consular affairs was responsible for both the Commercial and Consular Departments, which remained, however, separate entities. In March 1967, in preparation for the formation of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, a Joint Foreign Office/Commonwealth Office Consular Department was established, replacing the Consular Department and the Commonwealth Office Nationality and Consular Department. This became the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Consular Department upon the creation of the new Office in October 1968.
Arrangement: From the beginning of 1950 a revised filing system was adopted by the Foreign Office. This system was based on: i) an initial letter (or letters) indicating the Department concerned ii) a file number iii) a further number indicating the particular paper in the file A separate series of code numbers for countries was used together with the file numbers for papers filed in the Claims, Consular and Information Policy Departments. This modification does not affect the basic filing principle, thus KG 1021/7 stands for paper 7 on file 1 in the consular Department's Argentina series.
